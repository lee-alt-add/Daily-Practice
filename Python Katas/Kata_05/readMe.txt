Exercise 1: Create and Access a Dictionary
Task
Write a function called create_person that takes three parameters: name, surname, and age. 
This function should return a dictionary with these values stored under the keys "name", "surname", and "age".

Exercise 2: Update a Dictionary
Task
Write a function called update_age that takes two arguments: person, which is a dictionary representing a person, and new_age, which is an integer. 
This function should update the "age" key in the dictionary with the value of new_age.

Exercise 3: Add a New Key-Value Pair
Task
Write a function called add_phone_number that takes two arguments: person, which is a dictionary representing a person, and phone_number, which is a string. 
This function should add a new key "phone_number" to the dictionary with the value of phone_number.

Exercise 4: Remove a Key from the Dictionary
Task
Write a function called remove_age that takes one argument: person, a dictionary representing a person. 
This function should remove the "age" key from the dictionary, if it exists.

Exercise 5: Iterate Over a Dictionary and Print Information
Task
Write a function called display_person_info that takes one argument: person, a dictionary representing a person. 
This function should print each key-value pair in the format "key: value" on a new line.

Exercise 6: Iterate Through Dictionary Keys
Task
Write a function called get_keys that takes one argument: person, a dictionary representing a person. 
This function should return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

Exercise 7: Iterate Through Dictionary Values
Task
Write a function called get_values that takes one argument: person, a dictionary representing a person. 
This function should return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

Exercise 8: Tuple Basics
Task
Write a function called create_coordinates that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns them as a tuple (x, y).

Exercise 9: List Basics
Task
Write a function called append_to_list that takes two arguments: lst, a list, and item, an item to add to the list. 
This function should append item to lst and return the updated list.

Exercise 10: Set Basics
Task
Write a function called add_to_set that takes two arguments: s, a set, and item, an item to add to the set. 
This function should add item to s and return the updated set.

Exercise 11: Tuple, List, and Set Combined
Task
Write a function called process_data that takes a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a name and an age, e.g., [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25), ("Alice", 35)]. 
The function should return a dictionary where:
Keys are unique names,
Values are sets containing all ages associated with each name.

Exercise 12: Indexing in a List
Task
Write a function called get_element_at_index that takes two arguments: lst, a list of items, and index, an integer representing a position in the list. 
The function should return the element at the given index.

Exercise 13: For Loop with Lists
Task
Write a function called double_values that takes a list of integers as an argument. 
This function should use a for loop to return a new list where each integer is doubled.

Exercise 14: Nested Loop for Two-Dimensional Lists
Task
Write a function called sum_2d_list that takes a two-dimensional list of integers (a list of lists) as an argument. 
This function should use a nested for loop to return the sum of all integers in the two-dimensional list.

Exercise 15: Find Maximum in Two-Dimensional List
Task
Write a function called find_max_2d_list that takes a two-dimensional list of integers (a list of lists) as an argument. 
This function should use a nested for loop to find and return the maximum integer in the two-dimensional list.

Exercise 16: Combined Indexing, For Loops, and Two-Dimensional Lists
Task
Write a function called unique_values_from_2d_list that takes a two-dimensional list of integers (a list of lists) as an argument. 
The function should use nested for loops to iterate through each element and add it to a set (to ensure uniqueness). Return a sorted list of unique values.
