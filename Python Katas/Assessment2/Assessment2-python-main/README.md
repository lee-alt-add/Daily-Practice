# Assessment 2 - Python

## Purpose
This assessment is designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of fundamental Python concepts. You will be required to complete a series of functions in the `assessment.py` file. Your solutions will then be tested using the provided `test_assessment.py` unittest file.

## Learning Outcomes Assessed
This assessment focuses on the following Python skills:
- Defining and using **Functions** (parameters, return values).
- Implementing **Basic loops** (`for`, `while`).
- **Processing data** (manipulating lists, strings).
- Implementing **Basic error handling** (`try-except`).
- Developing **Simple algorithms** for problem-solving.

## Files
- `assessment.py`: This is the file you need to edit. It contains function stubs that you must complete according to their docstrings.
- `test_assessment.py`: This file contains unit tests to check if your functions in `assessment.py` work correctly. **Do not modify this file.**
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions.

## Instructions
1. **fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Understand the Tasks:**
    Open `assessment.py`. Read the docstring for each function carefully. The docstring explains what the function should do, its parameters, and what it should return.

3. **Implement the Functions:**
    Write the Python code within each function definition in `assessment.py` to meet the requirements described in its docstring.

4.  **Run the Tests:**
    Once you have implemented some or all of the functions, you can test your work. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved these files, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest test_assessment.py
    ```
    Alternatively, if your IDE has a "Run Tests" feature, you might be able to use that.

5.  **Interpret the Results:**
    - **OK:** If all tests pass, you'll see a message like `OK`.
    - **FAILURES/ERRORS:** If some tests fail, `unittest` will provide details about which tests failed and why. Use this feedback to debug your functions in `assessment.py`. The test output will show the expected output vs. your function's actual output.

6.  **Iterate:**
    Modify your code in `assessment.py` based on the test feedback and re-run the tests until all tests pass.

Good luck!
