# Daily Practice - Python Katas

---

## Description

Welcome to the **Daily Practice - Python Katas** repository! This repository is designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills through a collection of coding challenges, or "Katas." Each Kata is a small, focused exercise that targets specific concepts in Python, ranging from beginner to advanced levels.

Whether you're just starting out with Python or looking to refine your problem-solving skills, this repository provides a structured way to practice daily and track your progress over time.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of Python Katas for daily practice. By solving these challenges regularly, you can:

1. Build a strong foundation in Python.
2. Learn new concepts incrementally.
3. Improve problem-solving skills.
4. Track your progress over time.

Each Kata focuses on specific topics such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- File handling
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Error handling
- Advanced topics like decorators, generators, etc.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

```
Daily Practice/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Python Katas/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Kata_01/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py      # Solution code (hidden initially)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.py          # Optional: Test cases for the problem
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Kata_02/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.py
â”‚   ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helper_functions.py  # Common utility functions for exercises
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # This file
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE                  # Repository license
```

### Explanation of the Structure:

1. **Python Katas/**: This folder contains all the individual Katas (exercises).
   - Each Kata is stored in its own folder (e.g., `Kata_01`, `Kata_02`, etc.).
   - Inside each Kata folder:
     - `problem.md`: A detailed description of the exercise.
     - `solution.py`: The solution to the exercise (revealed after a delay).
     - `test.py`: Optional test cases to verify your solution.

2. **utils/**: This folder contains any common utility functions or modules that may be useful across multiple Katas.

3. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for getting started.

4. **LICENSE**: The license under which this repository is distributed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-practice-python-katas.git
   cd daily-practice-python-katas
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python installed. You can check by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Start Practicing**
   - Navigate to the `Python Katas/Kata_xx` folder for the Kata you want to solve.
   - Read the `problem.md` file to understand the task.
   - Solve the problem in a separate Python file or directly in the `solution.py` file.

4. **Run Tests (Optional)**
   - If a `test.py` file is provided, run it to verify your solution:
     ```bash
     python test.py
     ```

---

## How It Works

1. **Daily Challenges**: Each day, you can choose a new Kata from the `Python Katas` folder. These Katas are designed to be completed in a short amount of time, making them perfect for daily practice.

2. **Solutions**: Solutions to each Kata will be provided in the `solution.py` file. However, we encourage you to attempt the problem on your own before checking the solution.

3. **Track Progress**: Use the commit history to track your progress and see how far you've come.

4. **Learn Incrementally**: Start with beginner-level Katas and gradually move to more advanced ones as your skills improve.
